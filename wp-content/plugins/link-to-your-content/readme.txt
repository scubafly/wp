Gives you the ability to easily link to the various forms of content you have.

== Description ==

The Link to Your Content plugin gives you more control over how you link text or images to the content (real reach with the name I know) on your WordPress single and multi-site installs. Content such as:

* Posts
* Pages
* Custom Post Types (optional)
* Taxonomies (optional)
* Documents
* Images
* Media (everything not in documents and images)
* External Links (web sites or email addresses)

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract the plugin files
2. Upload `link-to-your-content` to the `~/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. View the settings page to turn on the ability to link to custom post types, taxonomies and across a multi-site if network enabled

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the icon to create the link? =

The icon is on the far right of the top row of the rich text editor and looks like a piece of paper with a chain link on it.

= I clicked on the icon and the popup window closed, what gives? =

In order to create the link you have to first highlight the text you want to link to your content.

== Screenshots ==

1. Settings page. Toggle linking to custom post types, taxonomies and content across a multi-site network. (The multi-site option is only available to super admins on a network site.)
2. Highlighted text that is to be made a link and the Link to Your Content icon in the rich text editor.
3. The Link to Your Content main window showing the full array of options available. Select the site you want to browse and the content you want to link to.
